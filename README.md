# Project_5_Gun_Violence_Tableau
IsmaÃ«l & Tatiana 

## Process 
* Data exploration with Python and identifying the data that needed cleaning
* Making a list of the charts/tables we wanted to build 
* Organizing them into categories (shooter profile, type of shooting, weapons and policies)
* Discussing KPIs (number of shootings/year, number of shootings in schools, number of casualties/injured...) for policy decision-making 
* Building data visualisations // data cleaning

## Data Points/Measures identified
Note : after visualising the descriptive data points, we can move towards crossing variables 

### Shooters
1. Gender
2. Age 
3. Race 
4. Mental health 
### Shootings
5. Shootings per year
6. Where do they take place ? Map by region
7. Where do they take place ? Location (school, work, etc.)
8. Mass or not 
9. Number of casualties, injured people 
### Access to weapons
10. Type of weapons
11. Legally obtained 


## KPIs 
* Number of shootings per year 
* Number of school shootings 
* Number of victims 

## Bonuses : 
* relate shootings to sociological data - poverty rate, GDP per state  
* relate shootings to NRA activity per state (or political/ policy context)
* relate shootings to religious practice.
