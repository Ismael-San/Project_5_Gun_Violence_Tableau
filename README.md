# Project_5_Gun_Violence_Tableau
IsmaÃ«l & Tatiana 

## Process 
* Data exploration with Python and identifying the data that needed cleaning
* Making a list of the charts/tables we wanted to build 
* Organizing them into categories (shooter profile, type of shooting, weapons and policies)
* Discussing KPIs (number of shootings/year, number of shootings in schools, number of casualties/injured...) for policy decision-making 
* Building data visualisations // data cleaning
* Building dashboards, discussing how to make them nicer, which colors to use 
* Creating the story for the presentation, with additional graphs 

## Data Points/Measures identified
Note : after visualising the descriptive data points, we can move towards crossing variables 

### Shooters
1. Gender
2. Age 
3. Race 
4. Mental health 
### Shootings
5. Shootings per year
6. Where do they take place ? Map by region
7. Where do they take place ? Location (school, work, etc.)
8. Mass or spree 
9. Number of casualties, injured people 
### Access to weapons
10. Type of weapons
11. Legally obtained 

## KPIs 
* Number of shootings per year 
* Number of school shootings 
* Number of victims

## Graphs  
1. Age of shooter (boxplot)
2. Gender of shooter (highlight table in %)
3. Distribution by race (treemap, %)
4. Shooters who exhibited signs of mental health issues (proportion, bubble plot)
5. Relationship between race and age of shooter (*not many data points for non-white, but differences in age can be seen*)
6. Shootings per month (line plot, running sum ): shows steeper increase after 2015
7. "Top 15" shootings in number of casualties (*8 took place in last decade - may explain the steep increase*).
8. Shootings, casualties and injured people, per month (3 - line plot)
9. Single KPI 1 : Number of shootings 
10. Single KPI 2 : Number of deaths 
11. Single KPI 3 : Number of deaths in school shootings 
12. Combined KPIs1-3 : shootings, fatalities and injuries, evolution over time (line)
13. Forecast : how will the number of shootings and the number of casualties evolve (*note there is not enough data for this forecast to be relevant*)
14. Geographical evolution over time 
15. Shootings and casualties per state (*some states show a higher number of casualties per shooting*)
16. Fatalities and injuries by shooting location (school, workplace...): shows more injured in schools and military locations. A lot of locations have been classified as "other". 
17. Weapons obtained legally vs. mental  health signs shown (*doesn't tell us much, most shootings occur with legally acquired guns*)
18. Weapons obtained legally vs. state (*doesn't tell us much either*)


## Dashboards
1. Shooter profile (age, gender, race, mental health issues identified) : our typical shooter is a white male of age 22 to 43, who may have shown signs of mental health issues. 
2. Evolution over time : shootings per month, deadliest shootings, and compared line plot of shooting occurrences, casualties and injured people. 
3. Full dashboard with KPIs, evolution of numbers over time, and possibility to filter by date and location. Identifies data source. 
4. Process : image dashboard showing our work process and trello board
5. Dataset : image dashboard presenting the dataset with new columns 

## Story 
Our story includes a commentary of our graphs and dashboards. 


## Bonuses : 
* relate shootings to sociological data - poverty rate, GDP per state  
* relate shootings to NRA activity per state (or political/ policy context)
* relate shootings to religious practice.
